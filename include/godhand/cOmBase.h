/* include/godhand/cOmBase.h - the base object of the cOm* family.
 *
 * cOmBase is the base class of the cOm* map objects (cOmWeapon derives from
 * it, and its collision bodies are cOmBase records too). One record is at
 * least 0x5E0 bytes; derived classes append their own state after it. Its
 * constructor (0x1B6E90) calls cGameObj first, so the record starts with
 * cGameObj's fields (CGAMEOBJ_FIELDS, 0x000..0x5AC) and adds three flag
 * words, a knock-back direction and a turn point. A child body's owner is
 * its cParts parent (0x148).
 *
 * Method names are the game's own, from the symbol table in the retail ELF.
 * Field names are ours, taken from the methods that read and write them.
 * Offsets are exact: every body that uses this header builds byte-identical
 * to retail. A field nobody has named yet stays as unkNNN padding.
